				<h3 class="tm-title" align="center">Layout Constructor</h3>

				<p>The Layout constructor provides a view of the objects on your page or post and with the help of which the objects may be manipulated and controlled. It makes so easy to define your page or post structure.</p>
				<p>Let's view it more detailed.</p>
				<p>First of all you need to get this Layout constructor from your Screen Options panel:
				
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/layout_constructor_1.png"></p>
				<p>Simply check box for Constructor and it appears under your Edit field:
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/layout_constructor_2.png"></p>
				<p>Each item represents the object on front page. Layout constructor builds schematic view of page real layout.</p>
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/layout_const_description.png"></p>
				<p>To get it started press Add row button which creates a row for elements added.
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/add_row_button.png"></p>
				<p>All objects displayed in the Layout Constructor are dragable, so can be easily manipulated, e.g. added, edited, reordered, deleted.
				<p>Let's say you would like to split text in four columns in first row and 3 columns in second.</p>
				<p>For this:
				<ol> 
					<li>press Add column button four times</li>
					<li>press Add row</li>
					<li>in just added row press Add column button three times</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p>Ending up all these pressings you should get this:
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/layout_constructor_5.png"></p>
				<p>Now you see schematic layout template of your text. The Layout constructor allows you to regulate each box width by a click "+"
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/width.png"></p>
				<p>Let's try to fill all these boxes with content. You no longer need to insert shortcodes inside shortcodes, it's never been so simple.</p>
				<p>To add and edit content for each column just press <img class="bordered align-center" src="images/pensil.png"></p>
				<p>In pop-up window you get Column content editor:
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/column_content_editor.png"/></p>
				<p><b>Notice:</b> Please keep in mind that effects for columns are available only under modern browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc. and  starts from IE 10.</p>

				<p>Here you can add any content you like, add media files, add text, format text, moreover all shortcodes are available here under green "+" button. So once you are done and your first column is ready press "Apply".
				<p>Here are simple examples how your text can be shown up with the help of this Layout constructor:
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/columns_1.png"/><p>
				<p>You can add to each column images, videos, any other shortcodes, etc.
					This Layout constructor makes you website looks alive.

			<h3 class="tm-title " align="center">Car Location and Car Producers</h3>
			
			
			<p>Before adding new cars you have an option to define <b><u>Locations</u></b> and <b><u>Producers</u></b> for your further cars base. We tried to make it easy for you and included the full package of Locations and Producers FOR FREE to this theme. With the theme installation you will get a preset Location and others comes with theme package which could be uploaded through DB migrate plugin. But also you can add more car Makers and Location in case you would need to add any specific ones.
			<h5>Location</h5>
			<p>This option gives you an ability to categorize the items due to location
			<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/location.png"/></p>
			<p>First you would need to add Country, for instance USA and click "Add new Car Location", don't forget to fill in the slug as well 
			<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/location_1.png"/></p>
			<p>Then you can add New State and apply it to USA by selecting USA in the dropdown menu, in this example we added Arizona 
				<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/location_2.png"/></p>		
			<p>And lets add Phoenix city to Arizona state in USA
			<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/location_3.png"/></p>	
			<P> As mentioned before you will be receiving all countries with the theme package and you can install the required country with all states, cities included. You need to go to Theme Options > Import/Export and in "Import Location" section click browse and select the path to required country and then click  upload. It would take few seconds to process and the this location appears in Cars>Locations.

			<iframe class="align-center bordered" src="https://www.screenr.com/embed/lHON" width="650" height="396" frameborder="0"></iframe>
						<hr>
			<h5>Producers</h5>
			<p>Here basically the same procedure takes place - add the name of Model and sub-model, slug and description. The Car producer here is used as parent for creating the the model. For example Honda should be selected as parent for adding Civic model.
			<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/producers.png"/>
			<p>However we pay your attention that our theme offers you to upload already created Producers database with all available Cars Makes and Models, as mentioned before you get these with the theme Package if you  install the demo content	</p>

			<h3 class="tm-title" align="center">Managing Users accounts</h3>
			<p>This theme is great for any type of car business. Even if you are not a cardealer and would like to connect your life with cars you can create a car market website where different users can post their car for selling and with this being said you can earn money by selling  upgraded account statuses for your users which will allow them adding more cars on web. Every new User gets the default account status and you can manage this account credentials, so lets take a look at this closer.</p?
			<p>Lets open Account Manager menu  Cars -> Settings - Account Manager.
			<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/account_1.png"/></p>
			<p>You can create different account statutes according to your need and business plans, so lets review our 2 examples we have created.  First is default account and we have set it as Default Account status. Lets take a look at this account.
			<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/account_2.png"/></p>
			<p> Here you can manage the following data: 
		<ul>
		<li>You can set the name for the account status</li>
		<li>You can set the Account life Period in days</li>
		<li>Account price, if its default one we left it 0</li>
		<li>You can set the maximum count of cars that the user with the default account status could add</li>
		<li>You can set the Disk Storage for Images in MB</li>
		<li>In Featured Cars count you can set the amount of cars that client can set as featured</li>
				<li>And Featured Cars Lifetime, meaning how many days the car would be set as featured</li>
		</ul></p>
		<p>And here is the upgraded status we have created: 
		<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/account_3.png"/></p>
		<p>Once the new visitor created an account on your website they can edit their profile and upgrade their account statuses  in "My Profile". They will see their status info and all credentials that are allowed by their account status. And if they decide to increase the  amount of cars they could add they just need to click "Upgrade status" and process the payment with the Paypal for selected upgrade.
		<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/account_4.png"/>
		<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/account_5.png"/></p>
		<p> Also you can create and offer to your users Featured Cars Bundles which will allow to set their cars as features to make sure their cars are always in top of the lists and its definitely going to help them sell their cars even faster. 
			<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/featured_1.png"/></p>
		<p>And you can edit the following data: 
			<ul>
		<li>You can set the bundle name</li>
		<li>Featured Cars Count</li>
		<li>One Featured Car Lifetime</li>
		<li>Bundle Price</li>
		</ul>
		<img class="bordered align-center" src="images/featured_2.png"/></p>
		<p>Users could purchase these bundles while editing their profile by clicking "Get More" button

			<section id="translate">
				<h3 class="tm-title " align="center">Theme Translation</h3>
				<p>The initial idea of our our CarDealer theme is to make it suits to any car business in any part of the world therefore we have made it translation ready.  For this purpose the theme comes with the PO files which could be translated with a help of any plugin suitable for PO translation. Just FYI you can use any plugin for translating PO files since there are lots of available plugins for tranlation purposes but we would recommend you to use Loco-translate as its free and has user-friendly interface. So in this post we are going to review on how to work with this specific plugin. First of you would need to download it and get it installed on your website. 

You can get it downloaded by following this <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/">link </a> Once you downloaded it you can install in a regular way as all WP plugins.  And then follow these advises below.</p>
      <p><img class="bordered align-center" src="images/loco_translate.png"/></p>
<p><h4 class="tm-title" align="center">1. Go to the Loco Translate home screen</h4></p>

<p>After you got it installed click the admin menu item that says "Loco Translate" (at the bottom of the left side-bar in the WordPress admin area). Clicking this takes you to the plugin home screen which lists all translatable 'packages'.</p>
On the home screen you will see all your available themes including CarDealer WP theme.

<p><img class="bordered align-center" src="images/loco_translate_1.png"/></p>

<p><h4 class="tm-title" align="center">2.Add a new language</h4></p>

<p>In the CarDealer theme row you should see a button that says "+ New language". To start translating the theme into another language click this button and you'll be taken to a new screen where you can choose the language you want.

Select a language from the dropdown list of common languages. In this example we'll select 'Spanish' and the text field below will be automatically populated with the language code "es_ES"<p>

<p><img class="bordered align-center" src="images/loco_translate_2.png"/></p>

<p>If you're offered a choice of where to create the new file, always select the global languages directory. You won't see this choice if only one of the options is found to be writeable, so check your folder setup and make  sure it's the global one.

Then click the 'Start translating' button and you'll be taken to the editor screen for translating the theme into Spanish.</p>

<p><h4 class="tm-title" align="center">3.Translate some string</h4></p>

<p>Once on the editor screen you'll see all the strings the theme has defined in its template file. Untranslated strings are shown in bold blue. To start with they will all be untranslated.

The basics of the editor should be fairly intuitive. Select the English string at the top and enter your 
translation in the pane at the bottom. You can ignore most of the editor buttons for now. We're just going to enter a translation and save it.</p>

<p><img class="bordered align-center" src="images/loco_translate_3.png"/></p>

<p>For our example we've picked out the phrase "Page not Found". Using the text filter at the top of the editor we can find this phrase quickly and select it in the list. Then we enter the text "Página no encontrada" into the bottom pane  as our translation.

The string at the top now shows a star icon to indicate that our changes are not yet saved.</p>

<p><h4 class="tm-title" align="center">4. Save your changes</h4></p>

<p>So far our new translation files don't exist on the server. Above the editor you should see the text "Updated: 
never". This just means the files haven't been created yet.

Continue to translate as much as you like and when you're ready click the Save icon in the editor toolbar.

Once the translation file is saved you should see a green success notification. Congratulations, you've saved 
your first WordPress translation file.</p>

<p>If everything has gone well, you now have Spanish translation files on your server for the Cardealer theme. Take 
a look in the folder you set up earlier and you should see two new files:<p>

<p>wp-content/languages/themes/es_ES.po<br>
wp-content/languages/themes/es_ES.mo<p>

<p>Checking they exist is good for our sanity and helps you see how it all works. The PO file is a human-readable 
source file. The MO file is the binary file that the Omega theme will ask WordPress to load.

Loco Translate has now completed its job. It has compiled a MO file and saved it to disk with the correct name. 
This is all it does. What happens next is down to WordPress and the theme.<p>

<p><b>Important part to know</b> - The theme has required plugins for proper work and each plugin has its own PO 
files so you would need to get these transalated as well. Simply scroll down to the plugins section and follow 
the same instructions for translating plugins PO as for the theme.</p> 
<p><img class="bordered align-center" src="images/loco_translate_4.png"/></p>

<p>This is just a basic instructions and we would recommend you to review the full basic instructions created by 
Loco team by following this <a href="https://localise.biz/help/wordpress/translate-plugin/beginners">link</a> 
and for advanced instructions follow this <a href="https://localise.biz/help/wordpress/translate-
plugin/overview">link</a> </p>



<p>In case you would like to like to make your website <b>multilingual</b> you would need to use WPLML plugin which is the 
best for this purpose and of caurse our theme is fully compatible with it. This plugin is not free but with purchase you get full documentation and outstanding support provided by developers team. You can find information and 
introduction video of this plugin by following this <a href="https://wpml.org/?aid=47521&affiliate_key=bRmsStwpmVd4">link </a> </b>

			<section id="pages">

				<h3 class="tm-title " align="center">Pages Templates</h3>

				<p>CarDealer includes great  Flex slider. It works fast, accurate and bright. That's how it looks:</p>
		<p><b>Flexslider</b></p>
		<p><img class="bordered align-center" src="images/flex_slider.png"></p>
		
		<p>Let's start. First step to make  slider is to create one or more slider groups to show. To do this you go to <b>admin panel > Slider Groups</b></p>
		<p><img class="bordered align-center" src="images/add_new_slide.png"></p>
		<p>From the very beginning give a name for this slider group. 
			<p><b><b>Note:</b></b> Please keep in mind do not repeat the names for slider groups even if you delete one.</p> 
			<p>Clicking on "Add slides" button provides you with pop-up media gallery window where you can choose an image for a slide or few images at once (holding Ctrl key)</p>
		<p><img class="bordered align-center" src="images/insert_media_slider.png"></p>
		<p>After you check an image for slide press "Insert into page" button.</p>
        <p>Next step is slide editing. Here we have special form to fill:</p>
        <p><img class="bordered align-center" src="images/add_new_slide_group.png"/></p>
        <p>So,in an appropriate section fill in box for this <b>slide title and subtitle, choose font family, font size and text color for both. Also you are able to add a link to a slide and enable "Show button"</b>. Do not forget press "Publish" when you  are finished.</p>
        <p>Once all images for slider are added and slider group is full we are going to show it on our front page. By the way, it is possible to have slider on any page you like. For this we are going to <b>Pages and choose here that page where our new created slider will be located</b>. In Page slider box you need to choose slider type and slider group to show up.</p>
        <p><img class="bordered align-center" src="images/Home_slider_type.png"/></p>
        <p>Save changes and refresh your Home page, new created slider will appear.</p>
